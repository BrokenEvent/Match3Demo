Match3Demo

Match3 C# engine with demo game

Nothing unusual. Why I've made this?.. I was veeeery bored.

// Some implementation comments.

The Match3Board is capable to process the whole game but it doesn't do this. It is better to call all the methods from the outside with required timing. For example after animations playback is done. Well, the Match3Demo form will answer how.
